# Stock-Purchasing-System

This builds upon the banking system found here: https://github.com/andrewsengupta/Banking-System
There is a cashBalance variable which links all the prior classes together.
The stock account can display current price for a stock symbol, buy stock, sell stock, display current portfolio, display transactions history, and return to main menu.
Stock info is stored in .txt files.
A vector manages the current list of stocks.
The list is sorted for every stock transaction.
